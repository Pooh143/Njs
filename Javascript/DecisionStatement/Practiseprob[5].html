     Write a JavaScript function that determines the price of a movie ticket based on age and time of the day:

            If the age is under 12, the ticket price is $8.
            If the age is 12 or above but under 65, the ticket price is $12.
           If the age is 65 or above, the ticket price is $6.
           If the time of the day is after 17 (5 PM) and the person is not a senior, the ticket price increases by $2.
